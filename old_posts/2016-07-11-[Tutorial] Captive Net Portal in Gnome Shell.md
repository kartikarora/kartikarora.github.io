Often when connecting to Public Access Points for WiFi - at Airports, Malls, Train Stations - we face the issue of "logging in" to get the internet access. 
Typical steps require you to open your browser and hit google.com so that you get redirected to login portal.

I'm not a very big fan of this process. Why can't the login page just popup when I'm behind a Captive Portal?

Turns out, it can happen, its only disabled if you're using [Gnome 3.18](https://www.gnome.org/gnome-3/) or above.

Follow the steps as shown in the video below, and you're good to go! I tested this on **Ubuntu 16.04** with _Gnome 3.20_.
